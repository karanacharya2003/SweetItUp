### 🖥 Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to Backend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
````

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**

   * Open `src/config.js` and update:

     * **Database Credentials** – host, port, database, username, password.
     * If using a cloud DB (e.g., TiDB Cloud), ensure `isrgrootx1.pem` is in `src/`.
     * **JWT Secret** – change to a long, random secure string.

4. **Run the Server:**

   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

   Backend runs on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 🎨 Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (clean installation recommended):**

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure API Endpoint (if needed):**

   * Default points to: `http://localhost:3000`
   * Update in `src/api/axiosConfig.js` if backend is on a different port.

4. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Frontend runs on: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
